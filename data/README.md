# Data

This folder contains the data for reproducing the analysis in the [2020 Data Science Honors Project](https://github.com/chrispyles/jupyter/tree/master/content/notebooks/).

As the data is too large, I have uploaded it to Google Drive as a zip file.
It is accessible [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vdj8xevAWL-wi56iXNdsFMT9iNr91fBJ/view?usp=sharing).

There are three folders:
* `Library of Congress`: contains all the 2D animated videos from the Library of Congress archive.
* `Prelinger`: contains all the 2D animated videos from the Prelinger archive.
* `Public Domain Review`: contains all the 2D animated videos from the Public Domain Review archive.

The license of all these videos are public domain.
