# Data

This folder contains the data for reproducing the analysis in the [2020 Data Science Honors Project](https://github.com/chrispyles/jupyter/tree/master/content/notebooks/).

The dataset I am using are
* the [LAFAN1](https://github.com/ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-animation-dataset/blob/master/lafan1/lafan1.zip) dataset (downloadable as a zip in the linked repository), and
* CMU's [panoptics](http://domedb.perception.cs.cmu.edu/dataset.html) dataset (script added to this folder to improve ease of download).
