# Data

This folder contains the data for reproducing the analysis in the [2020 Data Science Honors Project](https://github.com/chrispyles/jupyter/tree/master/content/notebooks/).

The dataset I am using are
* the [LAFAN1](https://github.com/ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-animation-dataset/blob/master/lafan1/lafan1.zip) dataset (downloadable as a zip in the linked repository), and
* a subset of the [CMU](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/) dataset (downloadable as a zip in the linked repository)
I also looked into using CMU's [panoptics](http://domedb.perception.cs.cmu.edu/dataset.html) dataset. I didn't end up using it, but a script has been added to this folder to improve ease of downloading this dataset.
