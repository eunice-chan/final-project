This project is for the Honors Project in DATA H195 at UC Berkeley. In this project, I explore video generation for animated videos. For more detailed information, see the [Preliminary Prospectus](writing/Preliminary%20Prospectus.md).

## Directory Structure

This repo contains a few subfolders which contain the elements of this project.

| Folder | Description |
|-----|-----|
| `data`  | data from the original analysis in CSV, TSV, and pip-separated format  |
| `notebooks`  | Jupyter Notebook files, including reproduction analysis using both `pandas` and `datascience`, as well as the Pre-Analysis Plan and a "blank" notebook  |
| `output`  | contains all output data  |
| `output/images`  | image files used in the Jupyter Notebooks  |
| `writing`  | Markdown files with text generated for this project  |

### Pre-Analysis Plan

This should be completed after you have your data set but before you begin your analysis. **Make sure to timestamp this document!** This is the whole point of a Pre-Analysis Plan. It should contain the following sections:

| Section | Description |
|-----|-----|
| Abstract  | an abstract for your project, excl. findings  |
| Data  | description of your data set (something akin to a synthesis of the Step 1 assignment)  |
| Strategy  | an outline of the steps you will take to analyze your data (mostly a description of the code)  |
| Analysis  | any heuristics or mathematical models that you use, and the reasons for their use  |
| Deliverables  | a description of the deliverable files in the repo, incl. where your presentation is  |
| Sources   | list of sources for your data _and any other research_ that you did  |
